# JSocial V1 Public Archive

This is an archive. This code was written between 2022-2023. PLEASE DO NOT EVERY TRY AND USE THIS. There are SO MANY BUGS and security issues.

You need to make a `db` folder, a `backups` folder, and a hidden.js file. The db folder has a bunch of files. Just read through the code.

`hidden.js` is like this. There used to be some private keys and API keys but they arent needed anymore.

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: "DEV",
};
```

You are free to use and distribute any of this code. If you decide to distrubute this code. You must change primary branding(name, logo, favicon, etc).\
ALSO PLEASE PUT A PROPER ENCRYPTION METHOD ON PASSWORDS. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD BASE 64 IS THE WORLDS WORST FORM OF ENCRYPTION.\
Also have fun fixing my messy and buggy code. Also the way database's are done in json is horrible.

I am ashamed to make this code public but oh well. Atleast I get to see how much I've improved.
